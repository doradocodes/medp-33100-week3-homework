# MEDP 33100 - Week 3 Homework
## Javascript and DOM manipulation

### Instructions 
1. Clone the repository (generated by Github Classroom, after you accept the assignment)
2. Update the `script.js` file to finish building the page:
- Use the `photos` array to add images to the `#gallery` container
- Show only 6 photos at a time. When a user clicks the "Load more photos" button, show 6 more photos.
- When a user clicks the "All" button, show all the photos
- When a user clicks the "Nature" button, show only the photos related to nature
- When a user clicks the "City" button, show only the photos related to cities
- When a user clicks the "Animals" button, show only the photos related to animals.
3. Push your changes to the `main` branch of your repository (this will automatically "submit" your assignment) 
4. Host your page using Github Pages

### Example of the final result
